## Introduction
Briefly introduce the project, its purpose, and the chosen algorithm (SVC) for handwritten digit recognition.

## Installation
Provide instructions on how to install the necessary dependencies and set up the project environment. Include any specific libraries or tools required.

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Usage
Explain how to use the project. Include code snippets or examples to demonstrate how to load the model and make predictions on handwritten digits.

```python
# Example code for making predictions
from sklearn.externals import joblib

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('svm_model.pkl')

# Make predictions on new data
predicted_digit = model.predict(new_data)
print(f"Predicted Digit: {predicted_digit}")
```
Dataset
Provide information about the dataset used for training and testing the model. Include details such as the source of the dataset, number of samples, and any preprocessing steps applied.

Model Training
Explain the process of training the SVC model. Include information on hyperparameters, cross-validation, and any other relevant details.

```python
# Example code for training the model
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the SVC model
model = SVC(C=1.0, kernel='linear')
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'svm_model.pkl')
```
Evaluation
Describe the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the model. Include accuracy, precision, recall, or any other relevant metrics.

Results
Present the results of the model, including performance metrics and any visualizations. Compare the model's predictions with the actual labels.
